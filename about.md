I have a passion for both mobile and web development. Over the years I have acquired a great deal of knowledge and experience through working with several languages and tools to become the best fit for the industry. I believe myself to be a quick learner, constantly learning from mistakes and keen to be a part of a passionate team where I could deliver my best by mutual sharing of knowledge and experience.
